Hello Ma'am, 

My name is Trupti Vaity. I am an incoming student for MS(Computer Science) program at Old Dominion University in Spring 2020.
As I am looking to opt for the thesis option in MS program, I am hoping to work as a Research assistant during this time.
I am highly interested in subjects like Image Processing, Computer Vision and Embedded Systems and wish to gain indepth knowledge and experience in these.
Working as an assistant with you on your projects will help me d





Unlike more traditional embedded systems, a full-fledged CPS is typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output instead of as standalone devices.[7] The notion is closely tied to concepts of robotics and sensor networks with intelligence mechanisms proper of computational intelligence leading the pathway. Ongoing advances in science and engineering improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent mechanisms, increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems.[8] This will broaden the potential of cyber-physical systems in several directions, including: intervention (e.g., collision avoidance); precision (e.g., robotic surgery and nano-level manufacturing); operation in dangerous or inaccessible environments (e.g., search and rescue, firefighting, and deep-sea exploration); coordination (e.g., air traffic control, war fighting); efficiency (e.g., zero-net energy buildings); and augmentation of human capabilities (e.g. in healthcare monitoring and delivery).[9]
